        <h2>RELEASE OF LIABILITY AND ASSUMPTION OF RISK AGREEMENT</h2>
        <p>
          THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AGREEMENT, PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY BEFORE
          SIGNING.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hereby affirm that I am aware that freediving and scuba diving
          (“activities covered by this Release”) are inherently dangerous
          activities that can cause permanent injury or death, even when done
          properly, cautiously and safely.
        </p>

        <p>
          I understand that diving with compressed air involves certain inherent
          risks; including but not limited to decompression sickness, embolism,
          oxygen toxicity, inert gas narcosis or other hyperbaric/ air expansion
          injuries that require treatment in a recompression chamber. I still
          choose to proceed with such instructional dives in spite of the
          possible unavailability of a recompression chamber in proximity to the
          location in which I shall carry out the activities covered by this
          Release, the Deep Dive Dubai diving pool.
        </p>

        <p>
          In consideration of the services of Deep Dive Dubai LLC and/or any of
          its affiliates and/or subsidiary entities, their agents, owners,
          officers, volunteers, employees, participants, contractors,
          subcontractors, service providers, designees, instructors, and all
          other persons acting in any capacity on their behalf, the
          manufacturers of equipment utilised for the activities covered by this
          Release, and any other landowners, property owners, tenants and
          sponsors connected with the activities covered by this Release
          (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Deep Dive Dubai”), on behalf
          of myself, my family, representatives, estate, heirs, assigns,
          successors and executors, I hereby unconditionally agree as follows:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>RELEASE OF LIABILITY</strong> I hereby fully RELEASE AND
            DISCHARGE my instructor(s) and Deep Dive Dubai LLC from any
            liability, claims, demands or causes of action whatsoever arising
            out of any damage, loss or injury or damages (whether bodily or
            emotional), or my property, or my disfigurement, paralysis or death,
            while preparing to participate and/or participating in any of the
            activities covered by this Release, whether resulting from the
            negligence or other fault, act or omission, either active or
            passive, direct or indirect, of any party, including Deep Dive
            Dubai, or from any other cause. Should I observe any significant
            hazards during my presence or participation in the activities
            covered by this Release, I will remove myself from the activity and
            notify the nearest official immediately.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ASSUMPTION OF RISK</strong> I understand, acknowledge and
            accept that my participation in the activities covered by this
            Release entails certain known and unanticipated risks and dangers
            that cannot be foreseen. I understand that these risks include, but
            are not limited to: equipment malfunction or failure to function;
            defective or negligent design or manufacture of equipment; improper
            or negligent operation, maintenance or use of equipment;
            carelessness or negligence of instructors and equipment operators;
            falling on or being impacted by other participants; slippery or wet
            equipment; impacting the ground and/or apparatus and/or pool props
            and/or associated mechanical structures; displaced safety equipment;
            general slips/trips/falls or painful crashes while using any of the
            equipment or the premises at large; operating out of control or
            beyond my or another participants’ limits; the negligence of other
            visitors who may be present; participants giving or following
            inappropriate advice; and my own negligence or inexperience. I
            voluntarily, freely, expressly and unconditionally choose to assume
            all of the risks associated with the activities covered by this
            Release, including but not limited to, all risks set out in this
            paragraph, and expressly understand that those risks may include
            bodily, emotional, mental, and personal injury, illness, heart
            attack, panic, hyperventilation, drowning, shallow water blackout or
            other forms of unconscious response, fatigue, exhaustion,
            decompression sickness, embolism, oxygen toxicity, narcosis induced
            disorientation, hyperbaric/air expansion injury, ear/ear drum
            injury/rupture as well related barotrauma injuries, sinus injury,
            damage, loss, damage to property, disability, disfigurement,
            paralysis or death to myself or to third parties. I understand all
            time spent in an underwater dry habitat is under pressure and is the
            same as time spent underwater. I understand that diving within an
            overhead area prevents my direct ascent to the surface and that I
            undertake such risks voluntarily and on my own volition. I
            understand that different breathing gasses have different depth
            limits and that I will be fully informed and trained before
            undertaking use of any breathing gas and that I will personally
            analyze these gasses and honor all depth limits therein associated.
            I voluntarily and freely choose to assume such risks and take all
            responsibility in respect of such risks, whether or not described
            above, no matter what the circumstances of the accident and/or
            injury.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AGREEMENT NOT TO SUE</strong> I agree never, at any time now
            or in the future, to institute any lawsuit or cause of action
            against Deep Dive Dubai or anyone else claiming on my behalf, or
            initiate or to assist in the prosecution of any claim for damages in
            respect of injury to person or property, or my death, or any other
            loss or damage howsoever occasioned arising from the activities
            covered by this Release, whether caused by the act, omission,
            negligence or fault, active or passive, direct or indirect or from
            any other cause, in any jurisdiction including without limitation
            any court in Dubai or United Arab Emirates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>PHYSICAL CONDITION</strong> I confirm that I have read,
            understood and completed the Medical Statement to the best of my
            knowledge. I certify that I am fully aware of my own physical
            limitations and have not been advised by a qualified medical
            professional not to participate in the activities covered by this
            Release and/or activities of a similar nature. I warrant that I do
            not suffer from any medical condition(s) or health-related
            problem(s) that preclude participation in the activities covered by
            this Release or which may result in me potentially being in a
            position of risk. I have not taken any alcoholic beverages, drugs,
            medicines or substances within the last 12 (twelve) hours which may
            impair my motor and visual skill, or cause any other impairment. I
            will avoid traveling to a high altitude for at least 24
            (twenty-four) hours after participating in the activities covered by
            this Release, including avoiding sky diving, undertaking air travel
            and/or ascending to a high altitude floor of a high-rise building. I
            confirm that I am physically fit and capable of undertaking the
            activities covered by this Release. Deep Dive Dubai will not make an
            evaluation or recommendation as to my physical limitations, and I
            will not construe any statement or action by Deep Dive Dubai as an
            evaluation of, or a recommendation as to, my physical limitations,
            with respect to whether I am physically fit to participate in the
            activities covered in this Release. I agree to abide by the decision
            of Deep Dive Dubai’s official or agent regarding my participation in
            the activities covered by this Release. It is my responsibility to
            immediately advise a member of staff of any condition that may occur
            to me and that I will immediately cease further participation in the
            activity. I irrevocably authorize that efforts be made to secure
            medical treatment for me and consent to all medical treatments and
            invasive procedures necessary or convenient in order to cure,
            stabilize or protect my life and wellbeing. I personally guarantee
            the payment of any cost or expense related to my medical treatment
            and/or the medical treatment of any person injured as a result of my
            participation in the activities covered by this Release.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>WAIVER OF CLAIMS AND INDEMNITY</strong> I understand that by
            signing this Release, I voluntarily release, forever discharge and
            agree to indemnify and hold harmless Deep Dive Dubai from and
            against any and all liabilities, claims, losses, demands, or causes
            of action, or proceedings of any kind and character, which are in
            any way connected with my participation in the activities covered by
            this Release, including such claims that allege negligent acts or
            omissions of Deep Dive Dubai. Should Deep Dive Dubai or anyone
            acting on their behalf, be required to incur attorney’s costs and
            fees to enforce this Release, I agree to indemnify and hold harmless
            for all such fees and costs. I additionally agree to indemnify Deep
            Dive Dubai against any legal cost, medical cost and any other
            expense arising from any and all injuries, liabilities or damages
            from my participation in the activities covered by this Release.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>WAIVER OF RIGHTS</strong> I understand that by signing this
            Release, I am giving up important legal rights, and it is my intent
            to do so and I do so of my own free will and with full
            acknowledgement of, and agreement to, the terms and conditions in
            this Release.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>TRAINING</strong> I understand that prior to participating
            in the activities covered by this Release, I shall receive a safety
            briefing. I warrant the thoroughness and completeness of any
            training and/or briefing I receive by voluntarily participating in
            the activities covered by this Release. I agree not to manipulate or
            interfere in any way with the infrastructure or equipment used in
            the activities covered by this Release including, but not limited
            to, underwater cameras, speakers and lighting systems, cabling and
            related fixtures, pool equipment, mechanical infrastructure,
            underwater habitats at 21m and 6m, and inappropriate disassembly of
            diving equipment, and I shall obey the instructions and safety
            warnings issued by Deep Dive Dubai at all times.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</strong> I understand this Release contains
            the entire understanding and undertaking by me in respect of the
            activities covered by this Release and the terms of this Release are
            contractual and not a mere recital and that Deep Dive Dubai is
            entitled to rely on this Release for its benefit. I confirm that I
            am of lawful age and legally competent to sign this Release. I
            understand that this Release can and will be used in court, and that
            agreements like this one have been upheld by courts in similar
            circumstances. I further agree that if any provision of this Release
            is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be
            severed from this Release. The remainder of this Release will then
            be construed as though the unenforceable provision had never been
            contained herein.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>WAIVER OF CONTRACT DEFENSES</strong> I understand that this
            Release is a binding contract pursuant to which I have released any
            and all claims against Deep Dive Dubai resulting in any way from my
            participation in the activities covered by this Release, INCLUDING
            ANY CLAIMS CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OR CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF
            DEEP DIVE DUBAI, as set forth in this Release.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CONTINUATION OF OBLIGATIONS</strong> I agree that the terms
            and conditions of this Release shall continue in full force and
            effect now and in the future at all times including (without
            limitation) during the period when I participate, either directly or
            indirectly, in the activities covered by this Release, and shall be
            binding upon myself, executors, administrators, personal
            representatives, and/or anyone else claiming on my behalf. This
            Release supersedes and replaces any prior agreement between the
            Release and myself.

          <li>
            <strong>PHOTO & VIDEO RELEASE</strong> I hereby grant Deep Dive
            Dubai and its legal representatives and assigns (hereinafter

            unrestricted right to capture, film, photograph, use and publish

            photographs, images or audio-visual clips for that purpose. I hereby
            hold harmless and release and forever discharge the Photographer
            from all claims, demands and liability relating to any such
            photographs, images or audio-visual clips of me.

            under this Release (including its interpretation, validity and
            construction) shall be governed by and subject to the laws of Dubai
            (excluding DIFC Courts) and the applicable Federal laws of the

          This is a statement in which you are informed of some potential risks
          involved in scuba or freediving and of the conduct required of you
          during the scuba or freediving activity. Your signature on this
          statement is required for you to participate in the scuba or
          freediving activity offered by <strong>DEEP DIVE DUBAI</strong>. Read
          this statement prior to signing it. You must complete this Medical
          Statement, which includes the medical questionnaire section, to enroll
          in the scuba or freediving activity. If you are a minor, you must have
          this Statement signed by a parent or guardian.<br />
          Diving is an exciting and demanding activity. When performed
          correctly, applying correct techniques, it is relatively safe. When
          established safety procedures are not followed, however, there are
          increased risks.<br />
          To dive safely, you should not be extremely overweight or out of
          condition. Diving can be strenuous under certain conditions. Your
          respiratory and circulatory systems must be in good health.
          All&nbsp;body air spaces must be normal and healthy. A person with
          coronary disease, a current cold or congestion, epilepsy, a severe
          medical problem or who is under the influence of alcohol or drugs
          should not dive. If you have asthma, heart disease, other chronic
          medical conditions or you are taking medications on a regular basis,
          you should consult your doctor and the instructor before participating
          in this program, and on a regular basis thereafter upon completion.
          You will also learn from the instructor the important safety rules
          regarding breathing and equalization while diving. Improper use of
          dive equipment can result in serious injury. You must be thoroughly
          instructed in its use under direct supervision of a qualified
          instructor to use it safely.<br />
          If you have any additional questions regarding this Medical Statement
          or the Medical Questionnaire section, review them with your instructor
          before signing.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
          The purpose of this Medical Questionnaire is to find out if you should
          be examined by your doctor before participating in diving activity. A
          positive response to a question does not necessarily disqualify you
          from diving. A positive response means that there is a preexisting
          condition that may affect your safety while diving and you must seek
          the advice of your physician prior to engaging in dive activities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please answer the following questions on your past or present medical
          history with a <strong>YES</strong> or <strong>NO</strong>. If you are
          not sure, answer <strong>YES</strong>. If any of these items apply to
          you, we must request that you consult with a physician prior to
          participating in scuba or freediving activities. Your instructor can
          supply you with an RSTC Medical Statement and Guidelines for a
          physical examination to take to your physician.
