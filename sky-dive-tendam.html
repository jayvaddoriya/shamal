            management for reviewal and the customer may be eligible for a
            refund of AED 300 only (i.e. the price of the photos and video).

                  By checking here, you are consenting to the use of your
                  electronic signature in lieu of an original signature on
                  paper. You have the right to request that you sign a paper
                  copy instead. By checking here, you are waiving that right.
                  After consent, you may, upon written request to us, obtain a
                  paper copy of an electronic record. No fee will be charged for
                  such copy and no special hardware or software is required to
                  view it. Your agreement to use an electronic signature with us
                  for any documents will continue until such time as you notify
                  us in writing that you no longer wish to use an electronic
                  signature. There is no penalty for withdrawing your consent.
                  You should always make sure that we have a current email
                  address in order to contact you regarding any changes, if
                  necessary.
